Vocabulary App v 1.1

This application was created to support learning french language.
Later on it may be modified to include other languages.

It allows you to store vocabulary you have already learned
and run simple tests to check how well you remember it.

You can store words in different tables and test yourself from the
contents of one table or all words you have inserted so far.

Application has built-in table 'Basics' containing most basic polish and
french words. You can expand it or create more tables.

While inserting new words you may only use LOWERCASE LETTERS.
During testing your answers are changed to lower case and then compared with
stored translation.

Right now this app is in early development so bugs may occur.

I will be thankful for all bug reports and feedback.
