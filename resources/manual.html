All letters will be changed to lowercase and all leading and trailing white-spaces will be removed.<br>
You can insert commas into textboxes to put more than one word into one entry.<br>
This is useful when a word in one language can be translated to a couple of different words in another.<br>
For example, french word 'il' can be translated as either 'he' or 'it'.<br>
So someone who knows english and learns french should fill textbox in a following manner:<br>
First Language(english in this case) textbox: he, it<br>
Second Language(french) textbox: il<br>
When later during testing you're asked for the meaning of word 'il', typing eiher 'he' or 'it' will give you correct answer.<br>
